# angular-training

This is a web-application based on AngularJS and Bootstrap frameworks that is developed during training
in my ISSoft company. I'll code some exercises from course and will share them here.

It can be used as the first step in the world of Angular apps.


#### How to start

Please, install Node on your computer, then go to root folder of angular-training app and 
type _npm install_ in cmd. After downloading of all dependencies type _npm start_ in cmd and 
open browser. 

The pages with done exercises are available by url *localhost:3000/static/html/lab$.html*
where $ is number of exercise.
